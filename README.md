## Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict whether a person has/can have such health conditions as stroke and hypertension using a dataset containing demographic information as well as other physiological measures. In addition, average glucose level and Body Mass Index (BMI) is predicted using the information available. The overall goal is to identify those at risk of experiencing health issues to advise them better on how to act in case of emergency and what actions could be taken to improve their health.

## Data

The dataset used in the projects was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

## Content
- **Exploratory data analysis**. Inspecting data and investigating how features relate to each other and to the health markers that will be predicted.
- **Statistics**. Statistical comparison of BMI in different groups.
- **Stroke prediction**. Building and optimizing classification model to predict whether the stroke can occur or not.
- **Hypertension prediction**. Building and optimizing classification model predicting whether the person has hypertension or not.
- **Average glucose level prediction**. Building and optimizing a regression model for glucose level prediction.
- **BMI prediction**. Building and optimizing a regression model for BMI prediction.
- **Stroke model deployment and value**. In this section, model deployment is introduced and the practical usability of the model is discussed.
